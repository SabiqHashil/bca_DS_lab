#Search an element in the array using binary Search

1.start
2.read the size of the array as 's', the array as 'a' and the value to search 
3.set low = 0 and high = size - 1
4.while low <= high then go to step 5, otherwise 10 
5.set mid = low + (high - low) / 2
6.if a[mid] == value then goto 11
7.if a[mid] < value then set low = mid + 1 and goto 9, otherwise goto 8
8.high = mid - 1
9.go to step 4
10.value not found and go to 12
11.value found
