#Implement polynomial using array

1.start
2.read the order of the polynomial as n & cofficient of polynomial into a array as a
3.set pow = n
4.set i = 0
5.if i <= n, then goto 6, otherwise 11 
6.if pow > 0, goto step 11
7.if a[i] > 0 && i != 0, then print '+' and goto 9, other wise goto 8 
8.if a[i] < 0, then print '-' and goto step 9
9.print a[i], pow--
10.set i++ and goto 5
11. stop
