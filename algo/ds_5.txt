#Reverse a string using pointers

1.start
2.read a string as str
3.set l = strlen(str) and create two pointer called begin_ptr and end_ptr and set it into str
4.set end_ptr in to end of the stirng
5.set i = 0
6.if i > l/2 then goto 7, otherwise 9
7.swap *end_ptr and *begin_ptr and set begin_ptr++, end_ptr--
8.set i++ and goto 6
9.stop
