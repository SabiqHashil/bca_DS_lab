#implement singly linked list of integers

1.start
2.Define a Node structure with two members value and next
3.read the no.of elements in the LL
4.using forloop read the value one by one 
5.insert the value front of the LL
6. Create a newNode with given value
7. Check whether list is Empty (head == NULL)
8. if its Empty then, set newNode->next = NULL and head = newNode
9. if its not Empty then, set newNodeâ†’next= head and head = newNode
10. print the LL
11. while (head != NULL) then print the head->value and set head = head -> next
12.stop
