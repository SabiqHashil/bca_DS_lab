#implement singly linked list of integers

1.start
2.Define a Node structure with two members value and next
3.read the no.of elements in the LL
4.using forloop read the value one by one 
5.insert the value front of the LL
6. Create a newNode iwth given value
7. Check whether lsit is Empty (head == NULL)
8. if if is Empty then, set newNode->next = NULL and head = newNode
9. if its is not Empty then , set newNodeâ†’next= head adn head = newNode
10. print the LL
11. while (head != NULL) then print the head->value and set head = head -> next
12.stop
